Hey, Iâ€™m @LittrellG

I am a full stack developer for a consulting firm based in the DFW area of Texas. 
Prior to my full stack experience, I worked as a simulation and tactical application developer.

My Github profile doesn't have many projects in it at the moment, but that's mainly due to my schedule in the past.
I was working to transition from Aerospace Engineering to Software Engineering and spent a lot of time on school.
I just finished up my Masters of Science in Computer Science with Georgia Tech, and I'm ready to build up my personal projects.
