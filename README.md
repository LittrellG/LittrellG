Hey, Iâ€™m @LittrellG

I am a full stack developer for a large technology firm with sites across the United States. 
Prior to my full stack experience, I worked as a simulation and tactical application developer.

My Github profile doesn't have many public projects in it at the moment, but that's primarily due
to how much I involve myself at work and my past academic work that I cannot post publicly. I have
a few private repos that I can display if requested. 

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerardlittrell18/
